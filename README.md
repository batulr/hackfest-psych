## About project

- This web application helps in getting rid of our everyday waste. We usually have a lot of waste in our homes eveyday. Similarly, many shopkeepers will have a lot of waste at their workplaces.
- Sometimes this will be difficult for shopkeepers if waste keeps on increasing and it should be cleared on regular basis. So this web application facilitates by providing a facility to sell our waste to vendors who want to purchase that waste and make cash from it. 
- The seller needs to select a vendor who wants to purchase waste and the rider needs to pick that and deliver it to the vendor. 
- In this way, this website also helps riders in earning by delivering.
