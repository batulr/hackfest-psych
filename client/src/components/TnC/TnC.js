            <b>Undeniable protocols for Rider/Service Provider</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Objection to any of these obligatory terms automatically declares a
            rider not appropriate or acceptable to deliver service from
            PRECycle’s behalf.
          </p>
          <p>
            1) Vendors are authorized to alter the price of different scrap
            materials available in our rate card. As per our terms, it’s
            mandatory to buy scrap from customers at vendor’s obvious prices.

          <p>
            3) Our riders must carry a digital scale to our online/partnered
            customers. We provide electronic weighing scales to our service
            providers to guarantee or prevent any fraudulent activities. Without
            digital scale, a rider is ceased from catering his service to the
            customers whatever may be the case.
          </p>
          <p>
            4) We make available our company attires to the riders to prevail
            the trustworthiness of our service.
          </p>
          <p>
            5) Any misbehaving attitude towards a customer may lead to strict
            actions against the rider or may lead to discontinuations without
            refunds.
          </p>
          <p>
            6) Every new joining rider is provided with a Unique Identification
            number from our end. We hand over Identification cards to our

          </p>
          <p>
            If in any case, a rider or service provider fails to follow these
            protocols then he is not liable to claims for refunds. At any case,
            we do not refund any subscription amount to our riders once the

            Suppose, ABC organisation bought scrap worth Rs 49,000 in the month
            of May 2017, then the total amount this period will be Rs 1250.
          </p>
          <p>
            ABC organisation pays us= 500(Plus taxes) subscription fee +
            250(Plus taxes) + 250(Plus taxes) = Rs.1000(Plus taxes)
          </p>
          <p>Explanation:</p>
          <p>Rs 500 (Subscription tier fee) + (Rs 250x3: Top-up tier fee)</p>
          <p>
            Here, Rs 500(Plus taxes) is paid as subscription fee at the starting
            of the month which gives them leads of up to Rs 20,000.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the end of the month, when the worth of the entire scrap is
            calculated, ABC Recyclers have to pay Rs 250x3 (=Rs 750) under
            top-up tier for additional scrap of worth Rs 29,000 he purchased in
            the month of May 2017. This balance can be paid at the end of the
            month or during the month, but no later than 7th day of the next
            month.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please note that an additional late fee of up-to Rs 200(Plus taxes)
            can be levied for every Rs 250(Plus taxes) fee charged in the
            transaction tier.
          </p>
          <p>
